ANSI Terminal is a "dumb" terminal that emulates part of a VT100.  It is sufficient to use with vi under 2.11bsd, and it also works well as a dumb terminal for Linux.  It successfully allows editing using the "vim" editor.

This project contains the FPGA code and software for a CYC1000 FPGA board:

Both a termcap and terminfo file are provided, to enumerate the supported
escape sequences.

A companion project, ansi-terminal-kicad contains the KiCAD design files and a 3-D printable case.
