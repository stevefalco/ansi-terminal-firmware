The code in this directory was downloaded from https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-msm-shamu-3.10-lollipop-release/arch/m68k/lib

Initially, I tried using the libgcc.a file that comes with the Fedora
gcc-m68k-linux-gnu-10.2.1-3.fc33.x86_64 package, but it is compiled for
M68020 and above.  That libgcc.a includes instructions that are not legal
for the M68000, and if you try to use it, you will get a fatal exception.

Instead, we compile from source, using a custom Makefile that selects the
correct CPU for our hardware.
