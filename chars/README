This process is awkward, but here is what I did:

1) Create rawchars.xcf with each character on a separate line, in ascii
order from char 32 (space) through 127 (del).  The image is wider than needed,
because the gimp text tool doesn't like to be too constrained.

I fiddled with the font size, until I got the characters to be 8 pels wide.
While I didn't expect it, "w" was wider than "M"!

I didn't trim the width at this point.

2) I copied that to flattenedchars.xcf so I wouldn't have to start over if
I saw something wrong.  Once flattened, you cannot go back to text edit mode.

Flatten the image, but first set some cursors to remember how tall the
textbox was.  Then, do a rectangular selection, exactly 8 pels wide, and
trim the canvas to eliminate the slack.

The characters seem to be biased to the right, so most have a white column on
the left, but again, 'w' goes the whole way.  Thus, a string of 'w' characters
won't have any space between them.  Export the result as flattenedchars.png.

3) Check using "file" to be sure the png is 8 wide.  Then use the t.c
program to crate chars.mif.  It turned out that the font is 8x17, but I
reduced it to 8x16 to make the addressing nicer.  And the 17th line is
always blank, so we don't need it.

To get 24 lines in 480 rows, we want 8x20, so our vhdl will have to pad by
4 lines at the bottom.

This is also tricky, because most characters have one white row above the
character, but a few of the accent characters use that row!  The SKIP
parameter determines how much to throw away.  There is a little metadata
at the beginning of the PNG file, which we also need to discard.  This could
change in the future if Gimp changes its comment structure.

Here is how the "sharp sign" (#) should come out:

 560 : 00000000; -- ........ #
 561 : 00000000; -- ........
 562 : 00010010; -- ...@..@.
 563 : 00010010; -- ...@..@.
 564 : 00010110; -- ...@.@@.
 565 : 01111111; -- .@@@@@@@
 566 : 00100100; -- ..@..@..
 567 : 00100100; -- ..@..@..
 568 : 11111110; -- @@@@@@@.
 569 : 00101000; -- ..@.@...
 570 : 01001000; -- .@..@...
 571 : 01001000; -- .@..@...
 572 : 00000000; -- ........
 573 : 00000000; -- ........
 574 : 00000000; -- ........
 575 : 00000000; -- ........

I don't know how to type "DEL", so I made that one up by hand.
